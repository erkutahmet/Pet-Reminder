# 🐾 Pet Reminder App

The **Pet Reminder** app I developed is a mobile application specifically designed for pet owners. With this application, users can create reminders related to their pets, easily communicate with veterinarians, and keep up with current news. Additionally, it offers customization options based on personal settings. The application has been developed for the iOS platform using Swift and the UIKit framework.

## 🚀 Features

### 🗓️ Reminder Creation
It provides a user-friendly reminder system to help you keep track of important tasks such as feeding times, vaccinations, or veterinary visits for your pets.

### 📰 Current News
My application automatically fetches the latest pet-related news from the internet and displays it on the homepage. This way, you can stay informed about the latest developments while taking care of your pet's daily needs.

### 🐕‍🦺 Messaging with Veterinarians
With the one-on-one messaging feature with veterinarians, you can quickly communicate your questions and urgent situations regarding your pet to your veterinarian. This feature enables safe and quick communication during the time between veterinary appointments.

### ⚙️ Personal Settings
Users can easily modify the personal settings within the application to customize it according to their needs.

### 📱 User Experience
The application stands out with its simple and elegant design. The user interface provides an easily understandable navigation experience for all types of users.
